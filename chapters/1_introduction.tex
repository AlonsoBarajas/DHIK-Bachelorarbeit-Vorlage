\section{Citing}
For citing, you can use the $\backslash cite{}$ command and pass the name of the citation to it. The citation must be added to the \textit{refs.bib} file as a \textit{BibTeX} entry \cite{beeton2017debugging} $\leftarrow$ \textit{this is a citation}. If \textit{Google Scholar} is used, the cite in \textit{BibTeX} format can be copied by clicking on the "cite" button and then choosing \textit{BibTeX}. The displayed information can be copied and pasted into \textit{refs.bib} and later called in the text as previously shown.
